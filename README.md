# Asteroids Clone

The Asteroids clone was created by [James Socol](https://github.com/jsocol/asteroids/tree/main). I have modified his code, but his [original license](https://github.com/jsocol/asteroids/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) still applies, and his copyright text still accompanies the code. My thanks to him for making something cool and sharing it.
